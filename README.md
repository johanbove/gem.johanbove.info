# Johan's Gemini Capsule

This is my own Geminispace "capsule" hosted at gemini://gem.johanbove.info

The site is currently running on a Raspberry Pi 3 at my own house.

## What is Gemini?

Gemini is a new internet protocol which:

- Is heavier than gopher
- Is lighter than the web
- Will not replace either
- Strives for maximum power to weight ratio
- Takes user privacy very seriously
