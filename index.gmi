## 3. Plans

Sharing the ideas I have for this site.

* âœ” Set up my own - basic - Gemini server.
* âœ” Move the Gemini server to a more robust, complete system.
* âœ” Find out how to make Gemini pages dynamic.
* âœ” Add a Gemroll.
* Link the content from my Gopherhole here. Or copy it over?
* Find out how TLS Client certificates can be used to authenticate. -> See Molly Brown.

More to come later for sure...
Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜Ž
