## 1. About

This is Johan's first Gemini capsule. Bare with him while I explore the _Geminispace_.

Everything is currently hand-crafted in Vim. This site contains mostly logs and journal on Johan's experience with getting started with Gemini.

## 3. Plans

Sharing the ideas I have for this site.

* [x] Set up my own - basic - Gemini server.
* [x] Move the Gemini server to a more robust, complete system.
* [x] Find out how to make Gemini pages dynamic.
* [ ] Link the content from my Gopherhole here.
* [ ] Find out how TLS Client certificates can be used to authenticate.

More to come later for sure...
Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜Ž
