## Intro

This is Johan's first Gemini capsule. Bare with him while I explore the _Geminispace_.

Everything is currently hand-crafted text. This site contains mostly logs and journal on Johan's experience with getting started with Gemini.

## Elsewhere

I am easily found online. Here are my personal spaces.

My homepage also has all the information to reach out to me.

## Plans

Sharing the ideas I have for this site.

* âœ” Set up my own - basic - Gemini server.
* âœ” Move the Gemini server to a more robust, complete system.
* âœ” Find out how to make Gemini pages dynamic.
* âœ” Add a Gemroll.
* Link the content from my Gopherhole here. Or copy it over?
* Find out how TLS Client certificates can be used to authenticate. -> See Molly Brown.
* Update this site's TLS certificate to use TLS 1.3 instead of TLS 1.2

More to come later for sure...
Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜Ž

- Johan
