This is Johan's first Gemini capsule. Bare with me while I explore the _Geminispace_.

Everything is currently hand-crafted in Vim.

## 3. Plans

Sharing the ideas I have for this site.

* [x] Set up my own - basic - Gemini server.
* [ ] Copy the content from my Gopherhole here.
* [ ] Set up a publish system to include the files from my Gopherhole here.
* [ ] Move the Gemini server to a more robust, complete system like "Molly Brown".
* [ ] Find out how TLS Client certificates can be used to authenticate.
* [ ] Find out how to make Gemini pages dynamic. How to post data?

More to come later for sure...
Thanks for visiting.

- Johan
