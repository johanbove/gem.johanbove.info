Bullet-journal style notes, tidbits and blurbs.

## 2020-12-10, Thursday

* Comparing HTTP, Gopher and Gemini with transportation vehicles.
* Installed the pretty cool ScuttleButt client called *Planetary* as a beta release app on my iOS phone today. It's probably the most _commercially_ oriented Scuttlebutt client. It's well made and looks great. It seems faster than ManyVerse, although I cannot really say yet if it is really faster. Reported a couple of obvious "todos" for improvements. Pretty slick.
* Meanwhile I'm not sure what is going on with *Patchwork* on my PC. It seems to be stuck in a "Scuttling" phase. Update: So I have uninstalled *Patchwork* as it seems to be causing havoc in the Scuttlebutt internals on my machine in combination with Oasis. If Oasis keeps performing nicely, I won't have the need to Patchwork anymore anyway.
* Trying out mointing an external files system using autofs after reading ewok's instructions.

* Had to be Dad tonight when my son, who is almost 3, refuses to go to the potty or asks us to help him and he went full into the already full diaper. The full diaper was my mistake yes. I got upset a bit as he is capable of asking and requesting us for getting chocolates or watching video, but not for going to the bathroom. I really hope he'll get it one of these tires. We are so tired of having to deal with diapers.
* Woke up this morning after a great night thanks to a nice cup of camomille tea! I slept like a rock.
* Enjoying spending time on ScuttleButt Oasis. Talking about Minidisc and stuff.
* Thinking about trying out "The Web Minidisc Application" by Stefano Brilli.
* Wondering how long the "Gemini Space Cycle" will last? Re-reading some interesting pieces by Baud.baby on their fantastic Gopher hole.

* Really tired. Had a bad night. Going to bed now.
* Why is the *Matrix* chat network not more popular?
* Discovered my little Gemini Capsule has been indexed by the GUS.Guru search bot.
* Installed Lagrange v0.12.1
* Played a couple of "Among Us" games. Preparing for a company party. Being "The Impostor" is harder than it seems.

* Love it when my son says "See you alligator" and he expects me to say "...in a while crocodile".
* Spent some time on "Secure Scuttlebutt" and the "Oasis" client.
* After my father in law stopped drinking alcohol I drank a whole lot more #alcoholfree drinks myself. And I've come to enjoy it too. We tried many different brands and kinds, but my favorite alcohol-free #beer are the ones from the German brewery "Wunderbraeu" based in München. It's probably impossible to find outside of Germany unfortunately. The brewery also prides itself about being bio, sustainable and CO2 neutral.

## 2020-12-06, Sunday

* It is "Sinterklaas" or Saint-Nicolas today. My almost three year old has the pretty sweet situation where he is enjoying the culture of Flandres, Germany, Italy and the US. So today Sinterklaas brought him sweets and new toys since he has been a very good boy. I'm sure his friend, Santa Claus, will think of him the same in a couple of weeks.
* We went to the "Forst Graf Spee" and got a live Christmas Tree, one with roots still attached. Plan is to keep it alive as long as possible. The woods around the castle are stunning. And we enjoyed eating Goose - burgers. We had a good time outdoors!
* Put up the Christmas lights outside so we can show all our neighbours that it's the season to at least try to be a little jolly.
* We had a great day today!
* But on the other hand. I'm having weird issues with SSB Patchwork since I installed Oasis. Also Manyverse doesn't seem to sync my profile message anymore. Sigh. Peer-to-peer programming is hard. 
* Also, after unstalling some game today it seems Google Play Store experienced some form of weird corruption and I got the "Error checking for updates" error. Force quiting the Play Store and uninstalling some things I didn't need helped.
* Also uninstalled ManyVerse again as it I am honestly not enjoying use it. Too many issues with extremely long loading times, even when syncing on the same Wi-fi. I cannot afford _wasting_ my time with it any longer. So I will use "Oasis" for now to check on SSB updates occassionally. I will still keep my financial support for ManyVerse flowing, hoping the performance will improve soon with the latest changes as announced in the latest ManyVerse newsletter.

## 2020-12-05, Saturday

* Knowing how complex peer-to-peer solutions like Hyperdrives and Scuttlebutt's systems are, it's good to know we can also rely on simpler ways to keep in touch online through classic e-mail and retro protocols like Gemini and Gopher.
* Felt really gloomy and doomy today. Christmas shopping with masks on just still feels like we're stuck in a dystopian story that actually became real-life.
* Beakerbrowser v1.0 doesn't want to run on my PC anymore. Not sure why not.
* Re-installed ManyVerse on my Android phone and after a couple of hours of syncing, it's almost usable again. It is cool how one can restore their access through the 24 word password phrase. Something that really get into Beakerbrowser too. If only I had the time and the skills to add that in the app myself.
* Messing with folder permissions on a backup system of over 700GB of private pictures is playing with fire.
* Really impressed with Jake's work on Lagrange. Yesterday he released v0.12. Testing out the subscription feature.
* Google Recaptcha just got a whole lot more annoying with its "Click verify once there are none left.". WTF
* The lyrics of "The Number Of The Beast" by Iron Maiden really fit when Geminauts say "the web is the antichrist".

## 2020-12-04, Friday

* Wanted to thank Solderpunk and the Gemini community, including the p2p (ipfs, hyperdrive, dat) and SSB communities for offering ways out of the corporate control of the Internet.
* Thinking of adding some robustness to my home server by setting up *Fail2ban* to monitor all traffic.
* Reading more about the "Sardex" currency.

## 2020-12-02, Wednesday

* Joined the CirclesUBI "Berlin" Circles Bazaar assembly today. Introduced myself and learned more about the plans with the market place.
* Updated Scuttlebutt *OASIS* client/server again on my home PC. Waiting for the indexing to finish.
* Copied over the content of my last gemlog entry by hand into an HTML page and I disliked every minute of it. Spent too much time fiddling on HTML tags and then getting the formatting right. Gemini/txt is bliss.
* Rebooted my Cabal.chat setup. I keep my own channel around. Just in case someone tries to reach out to me over the peer-to-peer p2p web.
* My family is in a state of shock of what happened in Trier yesterday. It's hard to comprehend what goes through the sick mind of a human to step into a car and to try to kill as many people as possible. This "inhuman" killed 5 people, of which a nine month old baby, the father and the mother and injured many more for life. My heart is broken. I need to believe still that most people are good and want to bring joy and love to everyone.
* Changed the background color of my social.johanbove.info site to a something more neutral. Got tired of the ugly green. And I also removed the web font which was actually totally unnecessary. Hurray for one dependency on Google less.
* Reading and watching the "SolarPunk" content gathered in the excellent "The Dork Web" article.
* Pocket released their "Best of 2020" articles list.

## 2020-12-01, Tuesday

* Last month of this crazy year just started of.
* Enjoying the "feed" functionality of the Lagrange. It's great how it also allows me to keep up with Gopherholes.
* Discovered James Tomasino made a pretty informative and complete video on Gemini
* Going to check out *Astrobotany* to test out TOFU (self signed certificates) in Gemini.
* It's ironic that I work on the Web for a living, writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while enjoying Gemini so much. I guess Gemini is providing me an escape from that.
* Astrobotany is fantastic! I love it. Started my own seedling and visited some other people's plants and watered some wilting ones. Checked out the source code and it has some fancy programming.
* The *Perkeep* Project is alive! The latest release was 2020-11-11, version 0.11 "Seattle".

* Publishing my gemlog with the gemlog.sh script by nytpu with one addition to publish to my twtxt.txt feed.
* Changed the file names in the gemlog to be human readable.
* Decided to set the copyright license for this content to CC BY-SA 4.0

## 2020-11-26, Thursday

* Darn, I fell into a Finger protocol rabbit/gopher hole after visiting baud.baby's gopherhole. And now I'm learning all about the _inetd_ Super-Server.
* Oh hi 👋 Windows Terminal, long time no upgrade and update. Why do you want these files in chmod 755 when WSL wants them in 644? Argh! Problems when trying to mix up two different systems together.
* Fixed it by setting `git config --global core.fileMode false`.
* Id like to think of Gemini as the spaced out, more relax little nephew (or niece) from Gopher.
* I like *Nico's Gemini Capsule* structure as a wiki with files organized using tags. Going to check out their site generator.
* The *Amfora gemini client* is a pretty cool command line client. Feels up to par with Lynx already.
* It's that time of the year again where I pump myself full of sugar just to cope with the lack of daylight.
* Reading the *Gemini Mailing List* archive to catch up with the format is a good way to spend time while you're waiting for your build to finish.

## 2020-11-25, Wednesday

* Contemplating a structure for my gemlog. Not sure how to name the files. Do I keep everything in a single folder or date-structure it?
* Really impressed by Gemini. I had fun with Gopher too, but feel more at home here in Geminispace. It's just easier to get started. No more Gophermaps and finicky formatting FTW!
* Thinking the gateway issues from yesterday could be related to simply too high of a load on the litte Raspberry Pi. How to tell?
* How does Star Wars credit work in The Mandalorian? He lands on this planet and needs to get his ship fixed and asks "How is my credit here?" and people just know. How does that work?
* Missed out on meetings because of a nap... argh. 
* Feels good to be able to help out a friend figuring out which NAS to get.
* At certain times my dyslexia really flares up, especially when I'm anxious and nervous. I literally would write a sentence and forget whole words.
* How do you keep your project's dependencies up-to-date? JavaScript projects have become incredibly complex. I still remember the good old days where JavaScript was only used to flip a gif image on an image map mouse-over.
* Added my own Twtxt.txt feed to this Gemini Capsule.

## 2020-11-24, Tuesday

* Experiencing trouble with the *Twins* Gemini server after file updates. Perhaps something went wrong with my deployment process?
* Switching back to *gminsrv* to see if it has similar issues. Perhaps twins is having some trouble keeping up with requests?
* Impressed by the make build script to generate gemroll shared by Emilis. Going to give this a go later.

## 2020-11-23, Monday

* Created the Indieweb.org/Gemini entry.
* Added a Gemroll and links page.

* I've set my "gemlog" at /gemlog.
* Installing Solderpunk's "Gemfeed" and gave up because of an issue installing.

* Editing from Visual Studio Code on Windows instead of Vim so I can use emojis. Hey it's 2020 after all. 🙄
* Installed "Golang" on the Raspberry Pi 3.
* Changed the Gemini server to "Twins". Powerful features and easy install. In Go.
* Moving servers was really easy. Thinking of giving Molly a go next week.
* Enjoying _Lagrange_ as my Gemini client gui on Windows 10. It has a Wonderful design.
* Read the Gemini companion docs for robots.txt and subscriptions.
* Created bash shell scripts for quick publishing and posting in /gemlog. Refining as I go along.
